# Docs

Store at least one PNG screenshot here before submitting to the Community Plugins store.

Recommended filenames:
- `screenshot-settings.png` – plugin settings tab
- `screenshot-notice.png` – optional notice showing a webhook trigger

Update `readme.md` to reference the final assets once captured.
